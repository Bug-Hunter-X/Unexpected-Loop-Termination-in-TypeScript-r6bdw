This repository contains a simple TypeScript program demonstrating a potential source of confusion:  unintentional early termination of a loop using a return statement inside the loop. The `bug.ts` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.ts` offers a refactored version that avoids the issue.  Understanding the behavior of return statements within loops is crucial for writing clear and predictable TypeScript code.
